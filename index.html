              Campfire is an open-source, self-hosted, collaborative
              deploy-preview solution for containerized, headless frontends.
              Much like the way an actual campfire brings people together to
              trade stories, Campfire aims to be a central place for
              cross-functional teams to visually review and discuss proposed
              code changes or bug fixes early in the software development cycle.
            </p>

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Campfire generates a deploy preview for each pull request,
              showcasing the latest commit with the proposed changes, which can
              be accessed through a public URL. The URL directs users to their
              deploy preview, equipped with Campfire's suite of comprehensive
              feedback tools.
            </p>
            <p>
              Integrating a feedback interface directly into the deploy preview
              simplifies collaboration between teams and addresses common
              bottlenecks that delay project timelines.

            <h1>2 - The Problem</h1>
            <p>
              In the early days of web development, software engineers often
              made live changes directly on production servers, a risky practice
              that could easily break the website or service.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the industry matured, developers began adopting version control
              systems like Git and SVN to better manage and track code changes.
              However, these systems did not solve the problem of testing
              changes in a controlled environment before production deployment.
              <br />
              <a class="reference" href="#section-8-References">1</a>
              <a class="reference" href="#section-8-References">2</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              The rise of agile development and continuous
              integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices led to the
              adoption of staging environments. These environments allowed teams
              to test code in settings that closely mirrored their production
              environment, enabling them to identify and fix bugs without
              affecting the live application. Despite the benefits, staging
              environments introduced significant bottlenecks. Multiple
              developers often pushed their changes to a single staging
              environment simultaneously, leading to conflicts and resource
              contention. This not only caused delays and increased security
              risks but also led to bugs and higher operational costs.
              <a class="reference" href="#section-8-References">3</a>

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              The process of resolving bugs found in staging involves several
              structured steps, especially when using tools like GitHub:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Branch Creation</strong> - Developers create a new
                branch from the main codebase, allowing them to address bugs
                without impacting the stable production version.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Commit Changes</strong> - Necessary fixes are made and
                committed to the branch, with detailed commit messages
                explaining the changes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Push to Repository</strong> - The branch is then pushed
                to the remote repository on GitHub.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Create Pull Request</strong> - A pull request is opened
                against the main branch for merging the fixes and facilitating
                code review.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Code Review and Approval</strong> - The pull request is
                reviewed by team members who may suggest or request changes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Merge and Deploy to Staging</strong> - After approval,
                the changes are merged and deployed to the staging environment
                to verify the bug fix.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Testing in Staging</strong> - The application is tested
                in staging to ensure the fix is effective and no new issues have
                arisen.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Push to Production</strong> - Once confirmed, the
                changes are deployed to production.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Monitoring</strong> - Post-deployment the application is
                monitored for any unexpected issues.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              If bugs are detected during staging tests, the process from branch
              creation to staging deployment may need to be repeated to ensure
              all issues are thoroughly addressed.
              <br />

            </p>
            <p>
              Historically, non-engineering team members such as UI designers,
              QA testers, marketers, and product managers had limited
              opportunities to view and provide feedback on proposed changes
              until late in the development process. Often, they only saw these
              changes when they were moved to the staging or production
              environments.
            </p>
            <p>
              This delay not only prevented timely feedback that could influence
              design and functionality but also excluded these key stakeholders
              from early stages of project discussions. Additionally, the lack
              of a dedicated feedback mechanism in earlier development stages
              meant that their insights, which could significantly impact user
              experience and product success, were often underutilized or
              solicited too late to make meaningful adjustments without
              time-consuming revisions.

            <h2>2.1 - Deploy Previews</h2>
            <p>
              Deploy previews were introduced as a solution to streamline the
              code review process, allowing engineers to view changes earlier in
              the development process without the need to manually pull down
              code or wait for access to a staging environment. This drastically
              shortened the cycle between identifying bugs and deploying fixes,
              enabling faster iterations and more efficient development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Deploy previews also provided an accessible platform for
              non-engineering team members to view proposed changes. This
              expanded the review process to a broader group of stakeholders and
              enabled collaboration across different teams. Despite their
              effectiveness in demonstrating code changes, deploy previews
              initially lacked integrated tools for submitting feedback directly
              within the previews.

            <h2>2.2 - Limitations of Deploy Previews</h2>
            <p>
              While deploy previews were adept at showcasing code changes, they
              lacked an interface to provide feedback to the proposed changes
              within the same application. This forced users to use third-party
              tools to provide feedback on the proposed changes, like Slack and
              GitHub for comments or Loom and Zight (formerly CloudApp) for
              screen recordings, or Zoom for synchronous video calls. The absence of a
              unified feedback interface often led to scattered comments across
              many different platforms, complicating the aggregation and
              tracking of feedback, and often causing the context to be lost.
            </p>
            <p>
              Comments made across multiple different platforms led to
              disjointed communication, complicating the feedback process. Even
              if developers consolidated discussions on GitHub, non-engineering
              team members, such as project managers, designers, and QA
              personnel, were often left out of the loop. They often don’t have
              GitHub accounts and would seek a straightforward way to comment on
              visual changes. Not having a built-in, accessible feedback system
              in deploy previews made it harder to collaborate and quickly fix
              problems.

            <p>
              Several solutions have recently been developed to add a
              communication layer to deploy previews, making collaboration more
              accessible for non-technical team members. Services like Netlify
              Drawer, Vercel Comments, and Livecycle have attempted to bridge
              this gap by offering built-in tools for capturing feedback when
              the user is viewing proposed changes. Each of these services
              presents different tradeoffs, particularly in terms of hosting
              options, whether they are open-source, and the ease of setup and
              use.

            <h2>3.1 - Deploy Previews as a Feature</h2>
            <p>
              Netlify and Vercel integrate deploy previews within their broader
              suite of services, providing a production-like view of changes
              pre-deployment. Netlify, primarily a host for static sites and
              supports Jamstack projects, includes Netlify Drawer as a feature
              available for their deploy previews. Similarly, Vercel is tailored
              for frontend frameworks like Next.js, incorporating Vercel
              Comments into its regular services, so that non-engineering team
              members have the ability to provide feedback on their team’s
              deploy previews.
            </p>
            <p>
              Netlify Drawer enhances Netlify’s deploy previews with a feedback
              toolbar for screenshots, recordings, and comments. The Drawer
              comment feature allows for synchronizing feedback between the
              deploy preview and GitHub. Comments can be posted by Netlify
              Drawer’s bot if the user does not have a GitHub account.. This
              integration includes the user’s browser metadata in comments,
              providing context in order to make it easier for developers to
              recreate and fix any potential bugs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vercel’s Comments leverage Liveblocks, a third-party real-time
              collaboration tool, allowing users to attach comments directly to
              UI elements. This integration improves feedback by allowing more
              interactive and detailed discussions. Unlike Netlify, Vercel syncs
              their comments with Slack rather than GitHub.

            <p>
              These services, while feature-rich, come with the caveat of
              requiring full application hosting on their platforms, limiting
              flexibility for teams who prefer independent control over their
              deployment.

              Livecycle's preview environments are the core of their project
              offering. Livecycle offers a unique combination of deploy previews
              and collaborative tools through its products, Preevy and a product
              also named Livecycle. Preevy manages preview environments via
              CI/CD workflows or an SDK for external hosting. Livecycle
              integrates a feedback interface enabling commenting, HTML/CSS
              suggestions, and visual edit comparisons. Additionally, Livecycle
              provides debugging tools like screen size adjustments, rudimentary
              dev tools, and console access. Its session replay feature
              automatically captures user interactions within the preview
              environment, offering a replayable video that begins recording
              from the moment the user visits the deploy preview.

              A custom-built deploy preview solution offers a team complete
              control over their development and review process. This building
              process can be divided into two main parts: the deploy preview
              functionality and the feedback system, together encompassing up to
              40 steps or more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Implementing such a custom solution requires dedicated teams of
              engineers, integration with existing tools, and ongoing
              maintenance. The complexity and resource demands can make it
              overwhelming and impractical for organizations lacking extensive
              technical expertise in automating workflows and managing cloud
              service resources.

              Campfire removes the trouble of building a DIY solution from
              scratch while still providing organizations control over their
              data, and allowing integration into an existing CI/CD pipeline.
              Our primary goal was to design a feedback interface that
              integrates seamlessly with the deploy preview, ensuring
              stakeholders can provide feedback without switching contexts. This
              interface supports comments and session replays and allows the
              capture of contextual data to enhance understanding. Although not
              as feature and integration-rich as solutions like Livecycle,
              Netlify Drawer, and Vercel, Campfire offers an open-source
              alternative with comments that sync to a GitHub pull request and
              the ability to record sessions, providing context-rich feedback
              directly within the deploy preview.

              hosted temporarily until the pull request is closed. We faced two
              primary decisions in this area:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                How to automatically trigger a deployment when a pull request is
                made?
              </li>
              <li>How to host the client application once deployed?</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>5.1.1 Automatically Triggering Deployment</h3>
            <p>
              We initially considered using webhooks to trigger a self-hosted
              endpoint whenever a pull request was created by the user. However,
              this required deploying a dedicated service to handle webhook
              events, which would involve additional resources being provisioned
              on the user’s AWS account.
            </p>
            <p>
              We opted instead for GitHub Actions, a CI/CD platform that offers
              the flexibility of using either self-hosted or GitHub-hosted
              runners to automate workflows. This approach eliminates the need
              to manage separate resources for webhook responses. GitHub Actions
              automatically provisions an environment to execute our defined
              workflows, which handle tasks such as authenticating cloud
              services, spinning up the necessary resources for the deploy
              preview, and posting the preview URL back to the pull request.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, GitHub Actions manages the lifecycle of the runners,
              ensuring they shut down and clean up resources after execution.
              This efficiency and integration led us to choose GitHub Actions
              for automating the deployment of deploy previews. Consequently, a
              fundamental requirement for using Campfire is that the user’s
              application must be hosted on GitHub; therefore, we are currently
              unable to support users on other platforms like GitLab.

            </p>
            <h3>5.1.2 Hosting the Client’s Application</h3>
            <p>
              The next step involved selecting a service to temporarily host the
              client application. To accommodate a diverse range of applications
              and simplify the deployment process, Campfire chose to support
              containerized applications. Containerization packages an
              application with its dependencies and configurations into a
              standardized unit, or container, ensuring it runs consistently
              across any environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ensuring that the client application behaves the same way locally
              as it does once deployed minimizes bugs related to cross-platform
              compatibility issues. By focusing on containerized applications,
              we enhance the likelihood of successful deployments regardless of
              the specific setup or technology stack of the application.
            </p>
            <p>
              The use of containers required a way to manage their life cycles –
              deploying, updating, and terminating containers as pull requests
              are opened, updated, or closed. Container orchestration services
              provide many features in addition to managing the lifecycle of
              containers, including automated scaling and high availability.
              Without container orchestration services, manual management of
              container lifecycles and scaling would be required, introducing
              complexity and potential for error.
            </p>
            <p>
              We selected AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) because it
              simplifies container orchestration and easily integrates with
              other AWS services such as the application load balancer used in
              Campfire. ECS automates the deployment, scaling, and monitoring of
              containers, allowing us to deliver stable and consistent deploy
              previews without the burden of managing the orchestration layer
              ourselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              While other solutions like Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and
              Docker Swarm offer more control and flexibility in managing
              containers, they require deep knowledge of their ecosystems and
              are feature-rich, which can be excessive for our needs. Given that
              Campfire requires orchestration for just a single container per
              pull request, the simpler and less complex ECS is more appropriate
              than the more powerful but complex alternatives like EKS and
              Docker Swarm.

            </p>
            <p>
              Access to each deploy preview was the next step for Campfire.
              Within our setup with AWS ECS, each deploy preview operates as a
              separate task. A task is a running instance of a containerized
              application, specified by its CPU, memory, and network settings in
              a task definition. Each task is automatically assigned a public IP
              that can be used to access the running instance. These public IPs
              can change if a task is restarted due to updates, configuration
              changes, or scaling operations. To manage the dynamic nature of
              public IPs, we implemented an application load balancer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Generally, a load balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers. For Campfire, which hosts a single instance of a client’s application in a container, the load balancer functions more like a router. It efficiently channels incoming traffic to our preview tasks, using listeners to direct traffic according to predefined Campfire rules.
            </p>
            <p>
              The traffic is then routed through these rules to target groups,
              which are collections that map to specific ECS tasks, regardless
              of their currently assigned IP addresses. Having an application
              load balancer means access to Campfire’s deploy previews remains
              stable and continuous, even when individual tasks undergo IP
              changes due to restarts.
            </p>

                alt="Load balancer routing to target groups that direct traffic to ECS tasks"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              When configuring rules for the load balancer’s listener we first
              experimented with path-based rules for routing – directing traffic
              to specific services based on URL paths, for example,
              &quot;/client-app/12&quot; for accessing the preview of pull
              request #12. However, this approach proved inadequate due to 404
              errors when browsers requested additional resources not accounted
              for in the path-based rules.
            </p>

              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              The solution evolved to using host-based routing, where the load
              balancer would manage requests to a host like
              &quot;client-app-12.preview.campfire.com&quot; as an example,
              ensuring all subsequent resource requests for a particular preview
              consistently reached the correct service.
            </p>
            <div class="multiple-images">
              <p>

            <p>
              This method eliminated the 404 issue as the host-based approach
              accurately directed all related traffic to the appropriate deploy
              preview environment, regardless of the specific resource being
              requested.

              Campfire wanted to design a feedback interface that accomplishes a

            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                integrates with the deploy preview, so that stakeholders don’t
                need to switch contexts to add feedback
              </li>
              <li>
                handles comments, since this is the main way stakeholders can
                leave feedback
              </li>
              <li>
                allows the user to capture context, for when text comments alone
                aren’t enough
              </li>
            </ul>

              5.3.1 - Integrating the Deploy Preview with the Feedback Interface
            </h3>
            <p>
              <img
                src="images/case-study/integrating-fi.gif"

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              When it came to integrating our feedback interface with our deploy
              preview, we had two options:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Inject or ask the user to add the feedback interface to their
                application – perhaps as a custom web component, script, or
                using an iframe.
              </li>
              <li>
                Create a feedback interface application that embeds the deploy
                preview within it using an iframe.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              <img
                src="images/case-study/integration-options.png"
                alt="Feedback interface in deploy preview vs deploy preview in feedback interface"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              The first option involves running a single task, the deploy preview, with the feedback interface integrated directly into it. This approach could reduce costs because no additional components are active when there are no deploy previews. However, it complicates the user experience by adding an extra step, and may restrict the types of applications we can support due to the need to ensure compatibility with various frontend frameworks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since the second option would not require any additional work on
              the user’s part and would maximize on application compatibility,
              we decided to create a separate feedback interface that would
              embed the deploy preview. We built a React application with an
              iframe that points to the deploy preview.
            </p>
            <p>
              We opted for the second option, which requires no additional effort from the user and maximizes application compatibility. To achieve this, we developed a separate feedback interface, embedding the deploy preview within an iframe in a React application.
            </p>
            <table>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Component</strong></td>
                <td><strong>URL</strong></td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Deploy Preview</td>
                <td>client-app-12.preview.campfire.com</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Feedback Interface</td>
                <td>feedback-interface.campfire.com/client-app/12</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
              The user would be given the URL that pointed to the feedback
              interface, while the URL generated for the deploy preview would be
              used internally by the feedback interface application.
            </p>

            <h3>5.3.2 - Comments</h3>
            <p>
              Comments allow all stakeholders, including those without technical
              expertise or a GitHub account, to actively participate in the
              deployment review process enabling detailed feedback and
              discussions directly within deploy previews. Comments allow teams
              to discuss issues and suggest improvements, fostering an
              interactive and collaborative review environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              We designed Campfire to aggregate comments in both the GitHub
              interface and within the deploy preview itself. This dual
              visibility ensures that feedback is not lost across platforms and
              supports a unified discussion thread that all team members can
              follow and contribute to, regardless of where they choose to
              interact.
            </p>
            <p>
              To accomplish this, we needed to retrieve existing comments from
              GitHub pull requests and also enable the posting of new comments
              from within Campfire. The implementation of this commenting
              functionality involved use of GitHub’s API.
            </p>
            <p>
              GitHub has three options to authorize API requests, although this
              can be reduced to less than three depending on the API resource
              being accessed. For Campfire to obtain the necessary authorization
              in order to push comments from Campfire back to the GitHub pull
              request we could use:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Personal Access Token (requires GitHub account),</li>
              <li>User Access Token (requires GitHub account)</li>
              <li>App Installation Token</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Recognizing that not all Campfire users would have a GitHub
              account, we chose to utilize GitHub’s App Installation Token for
              authorization. This approach enables Campfire to post comments on behalf of users, allowing feedback added in Campfire to sync with the pull request. It also permits users who are not registered on GitHub to contribute their own feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="images/case-study/github-authentication.png"
                alt="types of github authentication"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Generating the App Installation Token requires the user or organization using Campfire to register and install a GitHub App with configured permissions. Once the app is installed, Campfire is able to generate the required authorization through its credentials and cross-post any comments made in Campfire directly to the pull request.
            </p>
            <p>
              To avoid exposing sensitive data from the feedback interface, the
              GitHub App’s credentials are stored in AWS Secrets Manager. Any
              GitHub-related actions taken requires retrieving these credentials
              beforehand to authenticate the GitHub App. The following diagram
              shows the flow for posting comments:
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="images/case-study/comments-flow.png"
                alt="Architecture/flow for posting comment"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Adding authorization to our requests also benefited our GET
              requests by increasing the rate limits and allowing GET requests
              to private repos.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using our GitHub app to authorize POST requests to the API,
              however, also meant that all Campfire user’s comments would be
              attributed to the App and not the individuals themselves who were
              leaving feedback:

              To get around this issue, Campfire displays a welcome screen for
              first time users before they are able to view the deploy preview.
              The name the user enters is then stored in their browser’s local
              storage, ready for use on subsequent visits. The user’s name is
              also displayed in the top right corner of the feedback interface
              and prefixed to any comments they make through Campfire.

              />
              <p>
                The welcome screen asks the user for their name before they can
                interact with the deploy preview.

            <p>
              Other context Campfire provides includes some basic information on
              the user’s operating system, browser, and screen-size appended to
              comments. It may be the case that the UI breaks in certain
              browsers, but not others, or when viewed at certain dimensions.
              Having the user’s browser stack info enables the engineering team
              to more easily replicate the conditions that lead to issues,
              thereby fixing any bugs much faster.

            <h3>5.3.3 - Exploring Screen Capture Solutions</h3>
            <p>
              Our team investigated enhancing the Campfire feedback interface
              with screen capture functionality to provide richer context for
              debugging and user support. The goal was to record interactions to
              quickly identify and address issues encountered by developers or
              users.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are a few different approaches to capturing user
              interactions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Screenshots</strong> - Capture a single moment, useful
                for documenting specific issues.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Screen recordings</strong> - Record a sequence of
                actions, providing a video-like overview of user interactions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Session replay</strong> - Record all DOM events to
                create a detailed playback of user interactions, offering
                comprehensive insights into user behaviors and issues.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Initially, we researched the SDKs of third-party tools such as
              Loom and Zight, which offer screen recording and screenshot
              capabilities. We decided to not use these solutions given that
              they’re not open-source or self-hosted, which doesn’t align with
              Campfire’s open-source design.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although screenshots and screen-recording provide visual context,
              we sought a more detailed capture of user interactions. Ideally
              any captured data should be useful for developers seeking to
              understand and accurately replicate issues users face. This led us
              to prioritizing implementing a session replay feature, which
              records DOM events in detail, facilitating a deeper analysis and
              easier replication of issues by developers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Session replay captures DOM events such as mouse movements,
              clicks, scrolls, keystrokes, and changes within the DOM. These
              events are stored in an array, and replay involves reconstructing
              the user session from these events. This method not only allows
              skipping periods of inactivity, enhancing storage efficiency, but
              also structures data in a way conducive to further analytics.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="images/case-study/events-array.png"
                alt="array of session replay events"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Conversely, screen recordings provide a continuous video capture
              of the user's screen, which can include elements outside the
              webpage context, like video streams and browser extensions. Screen
              recordings can also effortlessly capture content within iframes, a
              task challenging for session replay due to security and technical
              limitations.
            </p>
            <p>
              While screen recordings capture more visual information, they lack
              the parsability and storage efficiency of session replays. Session
              replays, recording only meaningful DOM interactions, avoid
              unnecessary data accumulation during inactivity and structure data
              for potential analytical use, unlike the less-structured nature of
              video files.
            </p>
            <p>
              After evaluating these options, we concluded that session replay
              offered the most advantages for Campfire's needs, aligning with
              our goal of providing actionable insights into user behavior while
              maintaining efficient data management.
            </p>
            <h3>5.3.4 - Implementing Session Replay and SDK</h3>
            <p>
              Choosing to implement a session replay feature was not without its
              complications. Because a session replay is by default not able to
              record events occurring within an iframe, we had some additional
              work ahead of us.
            </p>
            <p>
              We chose the rrweb library to implement this feature due to its
              ease of use and open-source nature. Cross-origin policies and
              browser security measures prohibit session replay libraries such
              as rrweb from accessing the contents of an iframe that are hosted
              on different domains. For Campfire, this meant we were unable to
              record interactions from the client’s application because the
              deploy preview domain and feedback interface domain were not the
              same.
            </p>
            <p>The following gif shows the blank screen that would result:</p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="images/case-study/blank-screen-recording.gif"
                alt="GIF of session replay being blank"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              In situations where developers have ownership of both the parent
              application and the child application, rrweb recommends embedding
              their library components into both applications. All recorded user
              interactions in the child application can then be sent to the
              parent application.
            </p>
            <p>
              The diagram below illustrates this solution in terms of Campfire’s
              use-case. Here the feedback interface is the parent application
              and the deploy preview (preview app) is the child application.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="images/case-study/embedding-rrweb.png"
                alt="rrweb in client app communicating with rrweb in feedback interface"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Implementing rrweb's solution to successfully display iframes in
              recordings required having rrweb’s component embedded in the
              client application. This presented an additional prerequisite for
              the user: the rrweb component (or an SDK) must be embedded into
              the application in order for the session replay feature to
              function properly. We initially dismissed this option as one of
              our priorities in developing Campfire was to have as few
              prerequisites for our users as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second option to rrweb’s solution was to programmatically
              inject the rrweb component into the embedded application. This
              removed the prerequisite for users to manually embed the component
              themselves. However, this idea was later deemed unviable due to
              security measures enforced by browsers. The same cross-origin
              policies that restricted rrweb from directly recording iframes
              also restricted the parent application from accessing the contents
              of the iframe.This meant the feedback interface could not
              manipulate the DOM of the iframe and inject the rrweb component.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img
                src="images/case-study/feedback-interface-blocked.png"
                alt="rrweb in client app communicating with rrweb in feedback interface"
              />
            </p>

            <p>
              The third option was for the client application to use special
              response headers when being retrieved from the feedback interface.
              In the HTTP request/response lifecycle, the
              Content-Security-Policy response header can be used to authorize
              certain origins to access the requested resource, in this case the
              client application, within iframes. This meant the feedback
              interface could be whitelisted and allowed to manipulate the DOM
              of the embedded client application.
            </p>
            <p>
              While this approach appeared to be a practical solution, using
              special response headers would require additional AWS services to
              append the response heads to resources. AWS’s Application Load
              Balancer does not provide a mechanism for adding response headers.
              AWS Cloudfront, on the other hand, provides the capabilities to do
              so. To avoid adding additional complexity to our AWS
              infrastructure, we did not choose this approach.
            </p>
            <p>
              After considering our possible solutions and their tradeoffs, we
              decided the simplest approach would be to create our own SDK and
              require clients to embed the SDK into their applications. The SDK
              abstracts away the rrweb library component and is responsible for
              transmitting recorded user interactions back to the feedback
              interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="images/case-study/rrweb-sdk.png"
                alt="Feedback interface communicating with embedded Campfire SDK"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Although the SDK adds an additional prerequisite for our users, we
              believed it was the most straightforward option for our first
              iteration of Campfire. An advantage of building an SDK is we can
              continue to build onto the SDK in the future to add new features
              to the feedback interface. Features that we had previously decided
              against due to the lack of inter-iframe communication can now be
              implemented with the addition of the SDK.
            </p>
            <h3>5.3.6 - Handling Ad Blocker Interference</h3>
            <p>
              After incorporating the rrweb library for session replay into our
              Campfire application, we encountered another issue: the entire
              Campfire app failed to load for users with ad-blocking extensions
              active in their browsers. This problem was traced back to rrweb
              being integrated into several of our React components, which are
              interconnected. When rrweb was blocked by an ad blocker, it led to
              a cascading failure, preventing the entire application from
              loading, not just the session replay feature.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="images/case-study/adblocker_blocking_campfire.png"
                alt="Campfire blocked by an ad blocking extension"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              To address this, instead of identifying and managing individual
              ad-blocking extensions, we focused on detecting whether the rrweb
              functionality was obstructed. If rrweb failed to load, we
              implemented a system to inform the user through a notification
              banner, advising them to disable their ad blocker to access
              Campfire.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="images/case-study/dynamic-loading-flowchart.png"
                alt="Dynamic loading of rrweb library and React components"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Implementing this solution involved exploring dynamic component
              and module loading in React. By adopting dynamic imports, we were
              able to conditionally load rrweb components, ensuring that even if
              these components failed to load due to an ad blocker, the rest of
              the application would remain functional. This approach also
              allowed us to display a banner alerting users of the need to
              disable their ad blockers.
            </p>
            <h3>5.3.7 - Serverless Backend</h3>
            <p>
              At this point, Campfire needed a backend to use GitHub’s API and
              to use the AWS SDK. Authenticated calls to GitHub's API were for
              retrieving and posting comments to pull requests, while the AWS
              SDK was needed to store user generated session replay data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Initially two approaches were considered for our backend
              infrastructure:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>traditional server-based backend</li>
              <li>a serverless architecture</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              A traditional backend setup would involve using a server, for
              example an Express application, paired with a web server, like
              Nginx, to manage API routing. This type of set-up would have the
              benefit of avoiding cold starts that are the result of using a
              serverless architecture. The trade-off is that the user would have
              to pay the costs of having a server running continuously, even if
              there are little to no requests being handled. Since deploy
              previews don’t necessarily need the speed that comes with avoiding
              cold starts, we thought it best to maximize cost-efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
              We opted for a serverless approach using AWS Lambda, a computing
              service that allows you to execute code without provisioning or
              managing servers. Using an API Gateway with Lambda integration did
              not require an additional service to be hosted for the backend.
              However, it did require the incorporation of several new
              resources, primarily the API Gateway and Lambda functions. While
              this choice added additional complexity to Campfire’s
              architecture, the services we chose to use are far less expensive
              than having multiple ECS services running on a cluster on the
              user’s account.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="section-5-4-Data-Storage" data-section="Data Storage">
            <h2>5.4 - Data Storage</h2>
            <p>
              <img
                src="images/case-study/storage.png"
                alt="Campfire's architecture with S3 highlighted"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              The primary data that Campfire needed to store was session replay
              data, which took the form of arrays of event objects. For storage,
              we considered AWS Elastic File System (EFS) and AWS S3 buckets
              (S3), both accessible via lambdas and capable of being shared
              across all containers if needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although both EFS and S3 would be able to support this data, they
              have slightly different use cases. EFS is meant to be a shared
              file system among multiple containers, and works well for when you
              need to structure your data in a hierarchical manner with nested
              folders and files. It’s primarily meant to be used internally by
              those instances.
            </p>
            <p>
              S3 is an object storage system that allows you store any type of
              data in an unstructured way, and lets you retrieve it using a
              unique identifier. It’s useful as a data store for objects that
              need to be accessed over the internet. With S3, access to stored
              objects could be available outside the containerized instances.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since Campfire didn’t necessarily need a shared file system, but
              rather a place to store discrete pieces of data to be retrieved
              later, S3 seemed a better fit. It also gave two more advantages:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                We could store our files for our Lambda functions in the S3
                bucket, which Cloud Formation could then pull from during set-up
              </li>
              <li>
                Opens up possibility for later storing user uploaded
                screenshots, which, because of the external nature of S3 items,
                would make the images available not just within the feedback
                interface, but also on GitHub pull-requests
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The following diagram shows our architecture as a whole:
              <img
                src="images/case-study/whole-architecture.png"
                alt="Campfire's overall architecture"
              />
            </p>

            <h1>6 - Future Work</h1>
            <h3>6.1 - CSS Editor</h3>
            <p>
              Integrating a CSS Editor into Campfire’s feedback interface would
              allow users to suggest CSS modifications directly within the
              preview environment. This feature would enable more detailed
              visual collaboration on styling changes and improve the process of
              refining the UI/UX. Proposed CSS changes could then be
              automatically formatted into code snippets and attached to the
              corresponding pull request, facilitating a smoother review and
              integration workflow.
            </p>
            <h3>6.2 - Screenshots</h3>
            <p>
              Introducing a screenshot feature would enable users to capture and
              share specific moments or layouts from their deploy preview
              without having to record an entire session replay. This would be
              particularly useful for visually documenting issues or
              highlighting design elements, providing a quick and clear
              reference point in discussions. Additionally, images can be posted
              to GitHub discussions directly instead of having a session replay
              link that takes users back to their deploy preview. .
            </p>
            <h3>6.3 - GitHub User Authorization</h3>
            <p>
              Enhancing Campfire with optional GitHub user authorization would
              allow users to interact with the feedback interface directly. This
              would ensure that comments and feedback are accurately attributed,
              enhancing traceability and accountability in the collaboration
              process.
            </p>
            <h3>6.4 - Reduce Costs</h3>
            <p>
              In the future, we also want to explore ways to cut costs, possibly
              using web components or other techniques. Our current setup has
              the client app and feedback interface on separate clusters, which
              can be inefficient. For example, the feedback interface's cluster
              runs non-stop, costing money even without active deploy previews.
              A better approach might be to merge the feedback interface with
              the client app before deployment. This could be done by injecting
              code or using web components, which would allow both parts to run
              on the same cluster, saving resources and money.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, we may consider implementing a scaling strategy
              where the system could automatically scale down to zero in periods
              of inactivity. This approach would reduce the cluster to minimal
              operational status, effectively cutting costs by not running
              unnecessary resources.
