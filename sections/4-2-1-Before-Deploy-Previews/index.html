<h2>2.1 - Before Deploy Previews</h2>
<p>In traditional software engineering practices, visual feedback during the development lifecycle was often delayed until near deployment, which led to significant revisions and delays. Non-engineering team members typically did not have early visibility â€“ only seeing proposed changes to the code late in the development process in a shared staging environment.</p>
<p>This method not only caused inefficiencies for developers but also led to a bottleneck in the development process. The reliance on a shared staging environment for visual feedback created a single point of failure where various features and changes converged, increasing the risk of conflicts and bugs that complicated the testing process. The lack of early, dedicated testing environments meant that many UI/UX and performance issues remained undetected until the development was near completion or after the product had already been deployed, further amplifying the risk of costly post-launch fixes and updates.
