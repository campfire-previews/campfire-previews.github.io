<h1>1 - Introduction {#1-introduction}</h1>
<p>Campfire is an open-source, self-hosted, collaborative deploy-preview solution for containerized, headless frontends. Much like the way an actual campfire brings people together to trade stories, Campfire aims to be a central place for cross-functional teams to visually review and collaborate on proposed code changes or bug fixes early in the software development cycle.</p>

<p>Campfire generates a deploy preview for each pull request, showcasing the latest commit with the proposed changes, which can be accessed through a public URL. The URL directs users to their deploy preview, equipped with Campfire's suite of comprehensive feedback tools.</p>
<p>Integrating a feedback interface directly into the deploy preview simplifies collaboration between teams and addresses common bottlenecks that delay project timelines.</p>
