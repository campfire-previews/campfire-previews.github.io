<h1>7 - Future Work</h1>
<h3>7.1 - CSS Editor</h3>
<p>Integrating a CSS Editor into Campfireâ€™s feedback interface would allow users to suggest CSS modifications directly within the preview environment. This feature would enable more detailed visual collaboration on styling changes and improve the process of refining the UI/UX. Proposed CSS changes could then be automatically formatted into code snippets and attached to the corresponding pull request, facilitating a smoother review and integration workflow.</p>
<h3>7.2 - Screenshots</h3>
<p>Introducing a screenshot feature would enable users to capture and share specific moments or layouts from their deploy preview without having to record an entire session replay. This would be particularly useful for visually documenting issues or highlighting design elements, providing a quick and clear reference point in discussions. Additionally, images can be posted to GitHub discussions directly instead of having a session replay link that takes users back to their deploy preview. .</p>
<h3>7.3 - GitHub User Authorization</h3>
<p>Enhancing Campfire with optional GitHub user authorization would allow users to interact with the feedback interface directly. This would ensure that comments and feedback are accurately attributed, enhancing traceability and accountability in the collaboration process.</p>
<h3>7.4 - Reduce Costs</h3>
<p>In the future, we also want to explore ways to cut costs, possibly using web components or other techniques. Our current setup has the client app and feedback interface on separate clusters, which can be inefficient. For example, the feedback interface's cluster runs non-stop, costing money even without active deploy previews. A better approach might be to merge the feedback interface with the client app before deployment. This could be done by injecting code or using web components, which would allow both parts to run on the same cluster, saving resources and money.</p>
<p>Additionally, we may consider implementing a scaling strategy where the system could automatically scale down to zero in periods of inactivity. This approach would reduce the cluster to minimal operational status, effectively cutting costs by not running unnecessary resources.</p>
