<h2>2.2 - Limitations of Deploy Previews</h2>
<p>The lack of a unified feedback interface forced users to rely on third-party tools to discuss the proposed changes. This forced users to use third-party tools to provide feedback on the proposed changes, which can slow down the development process. The absence of a unified feedback interface led to scattered comments across platforms like Slack or GitHub, complicating the aggregation and tracking of feedback, and often caused the context to be lost.</p>
<p>Even if developers consolidate discussions on GitHub, non-engineering team members, such as project managers, designers, and QA personnel, are often left out of the loop. They may not have GitHub accounts and typically seek a straightforward way to comment on visual changes. Not having a built-in, accessible feedback system in deploy previews makes it harder to collaborate and quickly fix problems. <a href="#8---references">8</a></p>
