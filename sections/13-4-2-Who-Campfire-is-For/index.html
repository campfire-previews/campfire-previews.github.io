<h2>4.2 - Who Campfire is For</h2>
<p><em>[add who Campfire isn’t for? Based on Joey’s feedback]</em></p>
<p>Campfire is designed to support front-end applications that meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosted on GitHub</li>
<li>Contains a Dockerfile</li>
<li>Backend-independent: Either doesn't require a backend or interacts with an externally hosted backend via API</li>
</ul>
