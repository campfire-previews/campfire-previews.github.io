<h2>2.1 - Deploy Previews</h2>
<p>Deploy previews were introduced as a solution to streamline the code review process, allowing engineers to view changes earlier in the development process without the need to manually pull down code or wait for access to a staging environment. This drastically shortened the cycle between identifying bugs and deploying fixes, enabling faster iterations and more efficient development.</p>
<p>Deploy previews also provided an accessible platform for non-engineering team members to view proposed changes. This expanded the review process to a broader group of stakeholders and enabled collaboration across different teams. Despite their effectiveness in demonstrating code changes, deploy previews initially lacked integrated tools for submitting feedback directly within the previews.</p>
