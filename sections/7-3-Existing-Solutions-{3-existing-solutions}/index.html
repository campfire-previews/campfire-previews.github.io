<h1>3 - Existing Solutions {#3-existing-solutions}</h1>
<p>Several solutions have been developed to improve the lack of commenting ability in deploy previews. Services like Netlify Drawer, Vercel Comments, and Livecycle have attempted to bridge this gap by offering built-in tools for capturing feedback when the user is viewing the proposed changes.</p>
<p>Netlify primarily hosts static sites and supports Jamstack projects, including Netlify Drawer as a standard feature. Similarly, Vercel is tailored for frontend frameworks like Next.js, incorporating Vercel Comments into its regular services. Alternatively, Livecycle's preview environments are the core of their project offering.</p>
<p>Each of these services presents different tradeoffs, particularly in terms of hosting options, whether they are open-source, and the ease of setup and use.</p>
