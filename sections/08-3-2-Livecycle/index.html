<h2>3.2 - Livecycle</h2>
<p>Livecycle's preview environments are the core of their project offering. Livecycle offers a unique combination of deploy previews and collaborative tools through its products, Preevy and a product also named Livecycle. Preevy manages preview environments via CI/CD workflows or an SDK for external hosting. Livecycle integrates a feedback interface enabling commenting, HTML/CSS suggestions, and visual edit comparisons. Additionally, Livecycle provides debugging tools like screen size adjustments, rudimentary dev tools, and console access. Its session replay feature automatically captures user interactions within the preview environment, offering a replayable video that begins recording from the moment the user visits the deploy preview.</p>
