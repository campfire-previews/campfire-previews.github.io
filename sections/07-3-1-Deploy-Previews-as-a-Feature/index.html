<h2>3.1 - Deploy Previews as a Feature</h2>
<p>Netlify and Vercel integrate deploy previews within their broader suite of services, providing a production-like view of changes pre-deployment. Netlify, primarily a host for static sites and supports Jamstack projects, includes Netlify Drawer as a feature available for their deploy previews. Similarly, Vercel is tailored for frontend frameworks like Next.js, incorporating Vercel Comments into its regular services, so that non-engineering team members have the ability to provide feedback on their team’s deploy previews.</p>
<p>Netlify Drawer enhances Netlify’s deploy previews with a feedback toolbar for screenshots, recordings, and comments. The Drawer comment feature allows for synchronizing feedback between the deploy preview and GitHub. Comments can be posted by Netlify Drawer’s bot if the user does not have a GitHub account.. This integration includes the user’s browser metadata in comments, providing context in order to make it easier for developers to recreate and fix any potential bugs.</p>
<p>Vercel’s Comments leverage Liveblocks, a third-party real-time collaboration tool, allowing users to attach comments directly to UI elements. This integration improves feedback by allowing more interactive and detailed discussions. Unlike Netlify, Vercel syncs their comments with Slack rather than GitHub.</p>
<p>These services, while feature-rich, come with the caveat of requiring full application hosting on their platforms, limiting flexibility for teams who prefer independent control over their deployment.</p>
