<h2>3.1 - Deploy Previews as a Feature</h2>
<p>Netlify and Vercel integrate deploy previews within their broader service suite, providing a production-like view of changes pre-deployment. Netlify’s Drawer enhances this with a feedback toolbar for screenshots, recordings, and comments, synchronizing feedback between the deploy preview and GitHub via a bot or via GitHub authentication. This integration includes the user’s browser metadata in comments, aiding in providing context in order to make it easier for developers to recreate and fix any potential bugs.</p>
<p>Vercel’s Comments leverage Liveblocks, a third-party real-time collaboration tool, allowing users to attach comments directly to UI elements. This integration improves feedback by allowing more interactive and detailed discussions. Unlike Netlify, Vercel opts to sync their comments with Slack rather than GitHub.</p>
<p>These services, while feature-rich, come with the caveat of requiring full application hosting on their platforms, limiting flexibility for teams who prefer independent control over their deployment strategies.</p>
