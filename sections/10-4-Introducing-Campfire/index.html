<h1>4 - Introducing Campfire</h1>
<p>Campfire removes the trouble of building a DIY solution from scratch while still providing organizations control over their data, and allowing integration into an existing CI/CD pipeline. Though not as feature- and integration-rich as solutions like Livecycle, Netlify Drawer and Vercel, it offers an open-source solution with comments that sync to a GitHub pull-request and the ability to record sessions to provide context-rich feedback right within the deploy preview.</p>
