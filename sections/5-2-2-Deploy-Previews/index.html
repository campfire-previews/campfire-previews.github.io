<h2>2.2 - Deploy Previews</h2>
<p>The introduction of deploy previews into software development workflows marked a significant advancement. As each new commit is added to a pull request, a new deploy preview is automatically generated. This provides a production-like view of the commitâ€™s proposed changes allowing for feedback on proposed changes to occur much earlier in the development process.</p>
<p>While deploy preview environments offer a snapshot of the latest changes in isolation, they primarily facilitate technical reviews rather than collaborative discussions. Their primary value is in enabling immediate, isolated testing of code changes, which helps in the early detection of issues and alignment of the product with user expectations. [2]</p>
