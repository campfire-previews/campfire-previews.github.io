<p>Campfire combines the strengths of deploy preview solutions like Netlify Drawer with the adaptability of Livecycleâ€™s model, offering a self-hosted, open-source alternative for teams to manage their preview environments. It fosters collaboration across different teams by syncing the Campfire feedback interface with the corresponding GitHub pull request, thus enhancing team communication and feedback efficiency.</p>
<p>Campfire grants teams complete control over their infrastructure, aligning with various development workflows. We also built a CLI tool to simplify the installation and configuration of Campfire. Our integration with GitHub automates the creation, deployment, and dismantling of preview environments, updating in real-time to increase collaboration throughout the development process.</p>
