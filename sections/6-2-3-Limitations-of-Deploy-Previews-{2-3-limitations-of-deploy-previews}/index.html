<h2>2.3 - Limitations of Deploy Previews {#2-3-limitations-of-deploy-previews}</h2>
<p>While existing deploy preview solutions are adept at showcasing code changes, most lack features to provide feedback to the proposed changes within the same application. This forces users to use third-party tools to provide feedback on the proposed changes, which can slow down the development process. The absence of a unified feedback interface can lead to scattered comments across platforms like Slack or GitHub, complicating the aggregation and tracking of feedback, and often causing the context to be lost.</p>
<p>Comments made across multiple different platforms lead to disjointed communication, complicating the feedback process. Even if developers consolidate discussions on GitHub, non-engineering team members, such as project managers, designers, and QA personnel, are often left out of the loop. They may not have GitHub accounts and typically seek a straightforward way to comment on visual changes. Not having a built-in, accessible feedback system in deploy previews makes it harder to collaborate and quickly fix problems. [3]</p>
