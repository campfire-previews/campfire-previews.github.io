<h1>5 - Developing Campfire</h1>
<p>In order to build Campfire, we identified four components of a collaborative deploy preview solution:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Automation</strong> - An automated process to generate deploy previews for each new pull request, or new commit to an existing pull-request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access</strong> - A reliable and straightforward method for users to access these previews to view and interact with the proposed changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feedback Interface</strong> - An integrated feedback mechanism within the deploy preview to collect and display feedback, allowing stakeholders to comment and discuss directly on the preview.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Storage</strong> - A place to store and manage Campfireâ€™s data.</p>
<p>This diagram is an overview of all the responsibilities we described and how they interact with each other:</p>

<p>[below is a GIF but thinking of making it interactive so it shows the relevant part of the architecture highlighted when the user hovers over some text next to it labeled automation, access, feedback interface and storage, rather than just being a gif]</p>
