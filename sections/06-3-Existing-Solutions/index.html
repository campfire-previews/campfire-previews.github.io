<p>Several solutions have recently been developed to add a communication layer to deploy previews, making collaboration more accessible for non-technical team members. Services like Netlify Drawer, Vercel Comments, and Livecycle have attempted to bridge this gap by offering built-in tools for capturing feedback when the user is viewing proposed changes. Each of these services presents different tradeoffs, particularly in terms of hosting options, whether they are open-source, and the ease of setup and use.</p>
